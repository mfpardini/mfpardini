- Hi, Iâ€™m Matheus and this repository was created to help me practice some of the technologies that I'm learning.
- I consider myself as a generalist, so I know a little about many things in the development area, such as web development, machine learning and AI, data engineering and other stuff.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that I could be useful.
